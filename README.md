# This collection of code was used by Stephen Bierschenk for the completion of his Master of Science at the University of Texas at Austin
# Python files (.py) are included for each substrate angle. Files labeled multiple will run a set of 11 particles evenly spaced across the nozzle inlet. Files not labeled multiple allow you to specify particle initial location.
# Data files (.txt) contain the imported gas profile data from COMSOL multiphysics simulations

# for any questions please feel free to reach me at: bierschenk@utexas.edu
